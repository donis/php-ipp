2008-06-21:
   - changed phpprintipp CLI's rcfile
     syntax to variable = "value"

2008-06-21 V 0.81:
   - worked on debian and tar.gz packaging
   - reshaped all the archive for concistency

2008-06-16:
   - changing some defaults on phpprintipp
   - writing phpprintipp man page

2008-06-15:
   - removing some time-sleepings in http backend: Works now
     with my brand new one TRENDnet TE100-P1P print server,
     and obviously with CUPS.
   - adding user/password inputs on tespage.php and
     advancedpage.php.
   - introducing "phpprintipp" CLI program. Works fine
     together with foomatic-rip (which converts PostScript
     to a printer-comprehensive format, with many adjustable
     parameters), or with GIMP printed-to-file files, or 
     standalone for (ASCII) text/plain. You may adjust
     $tempdir (/tmp) in to fit your system (a tempfile is
     necessary to avoid memory consumption, by streaming to/
     from it).
     type ./phpprintipp -h for help. TODO: add some options
     and manpage...

2008-06-03:
   - removing "tiny PrintIPP", as it was a hassle to keep it in sync...
   - adding BasicIPP (only printJob(), as tiny was).
     PrintIPP extends now BasicIPP.

2008-06-01 V.0.80:
   - adding ippException (see html docs)
   - changing debugging (now $ipp->debug is 0 for verbose to 4 for quiet)

2008-05-31 V.0.79:
   - add setUnix($socket) => set the socket path,
     enable unix socket mode (and disable tcp/tls)
     you can re-enable  tcp/tls by using setHost($host)

2008-05-15 V.0.78:
   - worked hard to find what was wrong with Digest auth.:
     CUPS server misconfiguration (do not put AuthType directive
     in "All" section, write a "Location /printer" instead ;).
   - Both Digest and Basic authentications are OK and verified.
   - for ones who uses the http backend furnished for other
     purposes, note the API has changed: you need to setup
     ($http)->port now.
   - Had fun with the postscript test page and the new CUPS banners pages.
     Fonts scalled and other geek features :P
     If you plan to use the banners, put them in /usr/share/cups
     __with a short name__.
     $ipp->setAttribute('job-sheets',array('startbanner',endbanner'));
   - Written 'testpage.php': a comprehensive example with no classes
     and only one function (copyright!). Good challenge :P

2008-05-13 V 0.77:
   - Realized that ipv6 addresses and port syntax
     is a complex stuff. Things are OK now.

2008-05-12 V 0.76:
   - working hard to get rid of messages
     about "Creating default object from empty value"
     and about default timezone (E_STRICT)
   - ipv6 addresses works, now
   - begining "exceptions rising support" (currently, only http connection)
     you need set $ipp->with_exceptions to to get them (backward compatibility)
   - documentation/usage.html : setJobAttributes were very confusing

2008-05-09 V0.75:
  - improved documentation (links, html cleaning, css, spelling)
  - modified http backend to use stream_get_metadata instead of stream_select
  - added setAuthentication, make setAuthentification an alias to it

2005-01-20 V0.74:
  - fixed a bug in http backend: were blocked with specific
    strings length.
  - public variable "attributes" filled systematically.
  - improved doc with variables documentation.
  - http digest authentication works (with CUPS)!
    don't forget to make "lppasswd -a user" before to test :).
    
2005-01-18 V0.73:
  - added CupsAcceptJobs adn cupsRejectJobs operations in CupsPrintIPP.
  - added CUPS specific job attributes in CupsPrintIPP.
  - added documentation for attributes
  
2005-01-16 V0.72:
  - Improved setAttribute and related: 1setOf xxx now supported:
    use setAttribute('attribute',array('foo','bar'))
        for 1set Of ...
    or
        setAttribute('attribute','foo') for one attribute only.
    NOTE: unsetAttribute('attribute') delete the complete set.
  - Corrected _integerBuild and _interpretInteger. Have doubts on values < 0.
  - Adding support for RFC3382 'collection' attribute *parsing*.
    No nested collection to test: it /may/ work for nested collections.
  - Adding operation setJobAttributes (From RFC3380) in ExtendedPrintIPP
  - Adding operation cupsGetDefaults (From CUPS-IPP-1.1) in CupsPrintIPP
  - correcting parsing of validateJob() operation: now result is found
    in $ipp->attributes.
  
2005-01-10 V0.71:
    Improved HTTP backend: loads systematically complete 
    response from server

2005-01-09 V0.7:
   Wriitten a new http_class which replace HTTP and SASL backend
        - same api
        - not very stable :)
        - identification mechanisms: Digest only
        - no SSL

2005-01-07 V0.6b:
  - Integrated changes by Manuel Lemos on _sendHTTP
    to merge with his new HTTP backend.
  
  - HTTP backend is no more shipped-with:
    You have to download it at
    http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/3.html

  - Largefiles: use V.06a, or patch the http backend :)
